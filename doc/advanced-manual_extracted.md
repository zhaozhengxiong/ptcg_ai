## I. Supplement to the Players’ Guide
In this section, we will further explain certain sections of the Players’ Guide in more detail. It is intended to clarify
questions you may have, and to provide further explanation on Pokémon TCG for advanced players.

### A. Pokémon
Cards used to attack your opponent using attacks printed on the card. Aside from Attacks, a player can use an Ability,
Retreat, Bench, or evolve Pokémon.

#### A-01 Attacks
◆
A player can only use one attack that is written on the Active Pokémon’s card during their turn. An attack
ends your turn. If you don’t use an attack and have no other actions to take, announce to your opponent that
you’re ending your turn.

◆
To attack, you need to attach the exact number or more of the same Energy type as the Attack Cost. You can’t
use the attacks that don’t satisfy this condition.

◆
Steps for using Attacks
Follow the steps below to attack.

1. Announce the Attack:
Decide which attack to use and announce it to your opponent.
a. If the Attacking Pokémon is in a state in which it can’t attack, you can’t announce all (or specific)
attacks. Tell your opponent that you’re ending your turn without attacking.
b. If the Attacking Pokémon is Asleep or Paralyzed, you can’t announce an Attack. Tell your opponent
that you’re ending your turn without attacking.

2. Check the status of the Attacking Pokémon:
a. If the Attacking Pokémon is affected by effects such as below, flip a coin to determine whether the
attack would be successful.

Example : Attack, Smokescreen (Cyndaquil SM8 016/095)

Your opponent flips a coin. If tails, that attack does nothing.
If heads, the attack is successful. Proceed to 2-b.
If tails, the attack does nothing, and it counts as if you didn’t use the attack. Your turn ends.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

b. If the Attacking Pokémon is Confused, flip a coin to determine whether the attack is successful.
If Heads, the attack is successful. Proceed to 3.
If Tails, the attack does nothing, and it counts as if you didn’t use the attack. Put 3 damage
counters on the Attacking Pokémon. Your turn ends.

## Follow the instructions on the card if the attack text says, “Before doing damage.”

## Damage calculation
Calculate damage based on the damage that is written on the right side of the attack name. Follow the
instructions if there are details related to damage in the attack text.
→ See Steps for calculating damage

5. Effects other than damage
Follow the instructions for everything else other than damage in the attack text. Unless otherwise stated,
follow the attack text in sequence.

## Effects that activate when a Pokémon is damaged by an opponent’s attack
If your opponent’s Active Pokémon has an effect that activates when doing damage, follow those instructions.

## Check for Knock Out
Any Pokémon that has no remaining HP by damage or effects will be Knocked Out.
→ See D. Knock Out

◆
Steps for calculating damage
Follow the steps below to calculate damage.

1. Attack damage calculation
a. The damage of an attack is the number on the right side of the attack name.
b. If there is a +, ´, or - symbol next to the damage number, calculate the damage according to that
attack text. Damage calculation ends when the attack’s damage results in zero or a negative number
due to multiplication or subtraction.

## Effects on the Pokémon dealing damage

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

If the Pokémon dealing damage is affected by effects that change the damage they’re going to deal
such as below, reflect that change to the damage of step 1.
Choice Band (SM1+ 049/051): The attacks of the Pokémon this card is attached to do 30 more damage
to your opponent's Active Pokémon-GX or Active Pokémon-EX (before applying Weakness and
Resistance).

If the total damage becomes zero or a negative number due to effects such as below, end the damage
calculation step.

Example: Attack, Ferocious Bellow (Stoutland SM1S 048/060): During your opponent's next turn, the
Defending Pokémon's attacks do 50 less damage (before applying Weakness and Resistance).

## Weakness Calculation
If the Weakness type of the Pokémon that takes damage is the same type as the Pokémon dealing damage,
calculate the damage of step 2 based on the number on the right side of Weakness.

## Resistance Calculation
If the Resistance type of the Pokémon that takes damage is the same type as the Pokémon dealing
damage, calculate the damage of step 3 based on the number on the right side of Resistance.
If the damage total becomes zero or a negative number due to Resistance, end damage calculation.

## Effects on the Pokémon that takes damage
If the Pokémon that takes damage is affected by effects that change damage such as below, reflect that
change to the damage of step 4.

Choice Helmet (SM8 085/095): The Pokémon this card is attached to takes 30 less damage from the attacks
of your opponent's Pokémon-GX and Pokémon-EX (after applying Weakness and Resistance).

If the total damage becomes zero or a negative number due to Resistance, end damage calculation.

## Final amount of damage
Once the final amount of damage is determined, place the corresponding damage counters on the Pokémon
taking damage.
If the Pokémon that takes damage is in a state in which it does not take damage from attacks, do not follow
step 6, Final Amount of Damage, but end damage calculation.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

#### A-0 2
Abilities
◆
Aside from attacks, some Pokémon have Abilities. Abilities are categorized into two kinds: ones that are
activated by announcing it and ones that are automatically active when that card is in play.

◆
An Ability that contains the wording “You may use” requires announcing in order to be activated. Unless
otherwise stated, it can be used in the Active Spot or on the Bench. Unlike an attack, using an Ability does not
end your turn.

Example: Ability, Ultra Road (Solgaleo-GX SM1S 040/060)
You may use this Ability once during your turn. Switch your Active Pokémon with 1 of your Benched
Pokémon.

◆
Steps for Abilities that require announcing

1. Announce the Ability
Decide which Ability to use from your Pokémon in play and announce it to your opponent. If there are
conditions for using that Ability, follow those conditions.

Example: Ability, Fluffly Pillow (Mareep 033/095)
Once during your turn (before your attack), if this Pokémon is your Active Pokémon, you may leave your
opponent's Active Pokémon Asleep.

If you can’t follow the conditions, you can’t announce the Ability. If you know that there will be no
change upon step 2, you can’t announce the Ability.

## Executing the steps
Follow the instructions in the Ability text. Follow all the steps in the sequence that is written in the Ability
text. However, if there are any special instructions or process, follow those.

◆
An Ability that does not include the wording “You may use” is treated as an Ability that is automatically active.
Unless there are any special instructions or process, follow all of the steps in the text. Abilities that are
automatically active can’t be nullified at the player’s will.

Example: Ability, Water Bubble (Araquanid SM1S 019/060)
Prevent all damage done to this Pokémon by attacks from your opponent’s
Pokémon.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

#### A-0 3
Retreat
◆
Retreat is when you move your Active Pokémon onto your Bench at your own will. If you retreat, you need to
choose 1 of your Benched Pokémon as your new Active Pokémon.

◆ You can only use Retreat once during your turn.

◆
When retreating, discard the amount of Energy printed on the bottom left corner of the card. If there’s no
Energy printed on the card, there’s no Retreat Cost.

◆
Any Energy (other than the cards discarded when retreating), Items, or damage counters attached to the card
remain attached and will move to the Bench.

◆
You can Retreat even when there are 5 Benched Pokémon. If you don’t have any Benched Pokémon, you can’t
Retreat.

◆
Retreating to the Bench removes all Effects and Special Conditions.

◆ Steps for Retreating

1. Announce to your opponent that you are retreating your Active Pokémon.
a. If you don’t have the amount of Energy specified under Retreat, you can’t Retreat your Pokémon.
b. Pokémon that are Asleep or Paralyzed can’t Retreat.
c. An Active Pokémon that’s in a state in which it can’t Retreat due to an effect from an attack such as
Bear Hug (Bewear SM1S 052/060) can’t Retreat.

## Discard the amount of Energy necessary for the Active Pokémon to Retreat.

## Move the Active Pokémon to your Bench and switch it with 1 of your Benched Pokémon.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

#### A-0 4
Put Pokémon onto Bench
◆
Basic Pokémon from your hand can be put onto your Bench.

◆
As long as the number of Benched Pokémon doesn’t exceed 5, you may put any number of Basic Pokémon
onto your Bench during your turn.

◆ When you put a Basic Pokémon from your hand onto your Bench, you do so one Pokémon at a time. You can’t
put multiple Pokémon onto your Bench simultaneously.

#### A-0 5
Evolve
◆
You can evolve a Pokémon by stacking a Stage 1 or a Stage 2 Pokémon that shows that pre-evolution Pokémon.
You can evolve your Active Pokémon or any of your Benched Pokémon. You can evolve as many Pokémon as
you like during your turn.

◆
Neither player can evolve a Pokémon on their first turn. Any Basic Pokémon that came into play or Pokémon
that evolved on that turn can’t evolve on the same turn.

◆
When a Pokémon evolves, it keeps all Energy, Items, and damage counters that were attached to the pre-
evolution Pokémon.

◆
Evolving removes all Effects and Special Conditions.

◆
After a Pokémon evolves, it can’t use the attacks or Abilities of its previous evolution.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

B
Trainers
Trainers are cards that help the action of a player or a Pokémon. Trainers are categorized into three sub-types: Items,
Supporters, and Stadiums. Each card has a different usage and effect.

#### B-0 1
Items
◆ Items are Trainer cards that as many of as you like can be played during your turn. Once you have played an
Item, discard that card. Items have a rule that states, “You may play as many Item cards as you like during
your turn.”

◆
Steps for playing an Item
1. If there are conditions for using the Item, follow the instructions.
If you can’t follow them, you can’t play that Item. If you know that nothing would change even if you
follow through step 3, you can’t play it.

2. Choose an Item you want to play from your hand and reveal it to your opponent.

## Follow the instructions on the Item card. Unless otherwise stated, follow all the steps in the Item text in
order.

## Discard the Item after you’ve played it.

◆
Some of the Items have additional rules such as the Pokémon Tool Rule, which states, “Attach a Pokémon Tool
to 1 of your Pokémon that doesn’t already have a Pokémon Tool attached to it.”

◆ A Pokémon Tool card can only be attached to 1 of your Pokémon in play. While it is attached, the written effect
is automatically active. Unless otherwise stated, keep the Pokémon Tool card attached to the Pokémon until
it’s Knocked Out. When it’s Knocked Out, discard the card along with the Knocked Out Pokémon. Keep the
Pokémon Tool card attached even when it evolves or moves to the Bench due to retreating.

E.g. Escape Board (SM5M 060/066)
The retreat cost of the Pokémon this card is attached to is
less, and it can retreat even if it’s Asleep
or Paralyzed.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

◆ Unless otherwise stated, follow all the steps that are on the Pokémon Tool card. Automatically active effects of
Pokémon Tool cards can’t be removed at the player’s will.

◆ A Pokémon Tool can’t be removed at the player’s will. Furthermore, you can’t switch it with another Pokémon
Tool you have in your hand.

#### B-0 2
Supporters
◆ Supporters are Trainer cards that can only be used once on your turn. Once you have played a Supporter card,
discard that card. Supporters have a rule that states, “You may play only 1 Supporter card during your turn.”

◆
Steps for using a Supporter

1. If there are conditions for using a Supporter, follow those instructions. If you can’t follow them, you can’t
play the Supporter. If you know that nothing would change even if you follow through step 3, you can’t
play it.

## Choose a Supporter you want to play from your hand and reveal it to your opponent.

## Follow the instructions on the Supporter card. Unless otherwise stated, follow all the steps in sequence.

## Once you have played the Supporter, discard it.

#### B-0 3
Stadiums
◆
Stadiums are Trainer cards that continue to apply an effect to both players and their Pokémon when a player
plays them. You may only play 1 Stadium card from your hand during your turn. A Stadium card has a rule that
states, “You may only play 1 Stadium card during your turn. Discard this card if a Stadium card with a different
name comes into play.”

◆
A Stadium you played from your hand stays in play. When either player plays a Stadium with a different name,
discard the Stadium that had been in play and switch it with the new one. A Stadium with the same name as the
one in play can’t be played from your hand.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

◆ The effects of Stadiums can be categorized into two sub-types: ones you announce to your opponent in order
for the effect to be activated, and ones in which the effect is automatically active by being in play.

◆ For Stadium cards that contain the wording “You may” or “player may,” they can be used after each player
announces the effect during their turn.
E.g. Brooklet Hill (SM2L 050/050)
Once during each player’s turn, that player may search their deck for a Basic
Pokémon or Basic
Pokémon and, put it onto their Bench. If the player does so, shuffle the deck.

◆
Steps for effects of Stadiums that need announcing
1. If there are conditions for using the Stadium, follow those instructions. If you can’t follow them, you can’t
use that Stadium. If you know that nothing would change even you follow through step 3, you can’t use it.

2. Announce to your opponent that you will be using the effect of the Stadium.

## Follow the instructions on the Stadium card. Unless otherwise stated, follow all steps in sequence.

◆ For Stadiums that do not contain the wording “You may” or “player may,” that effect automatically continues.
Unless there are special instructions or process, take all actions on the card. A player can’t remove a Stadium
effect that is automatically active at their own will.

E.g. Altar of the Moone (SM1+ 050/051)
The Retreat Cost of each Pokémon that has any
or
Energy attached to it is           less.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

C
Energy
◆
Energy are cards you need to power up your Pokémon to attack or retreat. Energy cards are categorized into
two types: Basic Energy and Special Energy.

◆
If you have an Energy in your hand, you can attach an Energy to 1 of your Pokémon per turn. There is no limit
on how many Energy cards you can attach to one Pokémon.

◆
Unless otherwise stated, Energy remains on the Pokémon even when it attacks or evolves. Keep it attached
until the Pokémon is Knocked Out. When it’s Knocked Out, discard the Energy cards along with that Pokémon.

◆
There are nine types of Basic Energy:                                                    and       . They can be distinguished by the
name and the symbol. Attaching a specific type of Energy to a Pokémon provides 1 amount of that type of
Energy. You can put as many Basic Energy cards as you like in your deck regardless of the deck rule that states,
“You can’t have more than 4 cards with the same name in your deck.”

◆
“Special Energy” is printed on the upper left corner of a Special Energy card. Special Energy is Energy that has
special effects. Their effect and use differ depending on the card. Unlike Basic Energy, Special Energy obeys
the deck rule “You can’t have more than 4 cards with the same name in your deck.”

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

D
Knock Out
◆
For Pokémon with no remaining HP from damage from attacks, effects of cards, or special conditions, the
Knock Out process takes place. If there is even one such Pokémon in play, the Knock Out process takes place.

◆
When to confirm Knock Out:
• At the end of the attack process
• At the end of Pokémon Checkup
• Other than the above, when a Pokémon has no remaining HP

E.g. Ability, Feather Arrow (Decidueye-GX SMA 004/059)
You may use this Ability once during your turn. Put 2 damage counters on 1 of your opponent’s Pokémon.

E.g. Rainbow Energy (SM1M 060/060)
When attaching this card from your hand to a Pokémon, put 1 damage counter on that Pokémon. As
long as this card is attached to the Pokémon, it provides 1 amount of every Energy type. If this card is
not attached to a Pokémon, it provides 1      Energy.

◆
Steps for the Knock-Out process
1. Begin the Knock-Out process if either player has any Pokémon in play that has no remaining HP.

2. Process any effects that activate when a Pokémon is Knocked Out.

3. The player who has a Pokémon that has no remaining HP treats that Pokémon as Knocked Out and
discards that Pokémon and all cards attached to it.

## Both players take the number of Prize cards that correspond to the number of their opponent’s Pokémon
that were Knocked Out.

## The other player moves the next Active Pokémon to the Active Spot.
If both players’ Active Pokémon are Knocked Out at the same time during Pokémon Checkup, the player
who goes next chooses their new Active Pokémon and puts it out onto the Active Spot. If your opponent’s
Active Pokémon has not been discarded, proceed to step 6.

## Put out your new Active Pokémon.
Unless your Active Pokémon was discarded in step 3, disregard this step.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

E
Win/Lose
◆
The player who Knocks Out the opponent’s Pokémon and takes all of their Prize cards wins.

◆ If there is no Pokémon in your Active Spot due to Knock Out or effects, you must put out a new Pokémon from
the Bench. If a player has no Pokémon to put as their Active Pokémon, that player loses.

◆
If a player can’t draw a single card from their deck when drawing at the beginning of their turn, that player
loses. The player doesn’t lose when they have no cards in the deck.

◆

## In Sudden Death, the game restarts from the beginning.

## Use only 1 Prize card.

## The player who takes the Prize card first wins.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

F
Pokémon Checkup
◆
Pokémon Checkup refers to checking each player’s Pokémon’s Special Conditions—Poisoned, Burned, Asleep,
and Paralyzed—at the end of each player’s turn. Pokémon Checkup does not count as either player’s turn and it
must be done for both players’ Pokémon.

◆
During Pokémon Checkup, not only the Special Conditions are checked, but the Pokémon’s Abilities and
Trainer effects are also checked.

E.g. Shrine of Punishment (SM7 094/096)
Between turns, put 1 damage counter on each Pokémon-GX and Pokémon-EX (both yours and your
opponent's).

◆
Steps for Pokémon Checkup

1. Check Special Conditions
Check Special Conditions in the order of Poisoned, Burned, Asleep, and Paralyzed. The check is done to
each player’s Pokémon at the same time.

## Check Abilities and Trainers’ effects that activate during Pokémon Checkup
Step 2 can be checked prior to step 1. You can’t check it during step 1.
If there are multiple effects that are activated in step 2, you can choose either to activate each effect
before step 1 or to activate it separately after step 1.

## Check for Knock Out
Pokémon that have no remaining HP due to Special Conditions or effects are Knocked Out.
→ See D. Knock Out

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

G
Setting up to play
The following is the order when setting up to play.

## Greetings and handshake
Shake hands with your opponent.

## Play a game of rock-paper-scissors to determine which player goes first.
The winner of rock-paper-scissors decides whether to go first or second.

## Place the deck
Shuffle the deck well and place it face down in the deck location.

## Draw 7 cards
Draw 7 cards from the deck and put them into your hand.

## Place an Active Pokémon
In the order of which player is going first, announce to your opponent whether you have a Basic Pokémon
in your hand. If both players have Basic Pokémon in their hand, choose one and put it out to the Active Spot
face down. If there is no Basic Pokémon, follow the steps below.

a. Tell your opponent that you do not have any Basic Pokémon in your
hand.
• If only you didn’t have one, proceed to b.
• If both players tell each other that they don’t have any, shuffle the hand into the deck after
revealing each other’s hand to one another, and redo from step 3.

b. Your opponent proceeds to step 7.
• If this is the second (or more) time of not having any Basic Pokémon in your hand, skip b.

c. Reveal to your opponent your hand that doesn’t include any Basic Pokémon. After doing so, shuffle the
cards into the deck.

d. Return to 3 and redo the steps.

## Put Pokémon onto your Bench
If you have Basic Pokémon in your hand after putting one as the Active Pokémon, you may put the rest
onto the Bench face down (you don’t have to). Before starting the game, you can put Basic Pokémon onto
your Bench whenever you like.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

## Place Prize cards
Take the top 6 cards of the deck and place them face down as your Prize cards.
After placing the Prize cards, if your opponent has completed 5d, you may announce the number of cards
for each time your opponent has to complete 5d. After announcing the number of cards, you draw that
many cards. If the card you drew is a Basic Pokémon, you may put it onto your Bench.

## Begin the game
Both players turn their Active Pokémon and Benched Pokémon face up and begin the game.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

H
Deck
◆
If instructed to draw cards, take the specified number of cards face down from the top of your deck, and put
them into your hand.

◆
If instructed to choose cards from a deck (search), check the face of cards in your deck as you look through
and choose the designated number of cards. Do not show your opponent the face of the cards you are looking
through. If choosing multiple cards, you may choose a number that is fewer than that number. You may also
not choose any cards, and if you do not, the card selection ends here. However, if instructed to choose
whatever card you like, you must choose the specified number of cards.

◆
If instructed to shuffle the deck, shuffle the cards so that each player can’t figure out the order of the cards.
When shuffling, keep the cards face down. When looking through the deck from effects such as “Search your
deck for ●● and put them into your hand,” as a general rule, you must shuffle your deck.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

## II. Card Text
Here, we explain certain card text that you see frequently. This section is designed to clarify terminology or questions
about the order of specific processes.

A
About Card Text
◆
If the card text is different from the game rules, follow the instructions on the card rather than the game rules.
However, if the card effect has been newly changed, use the latest effect.

◆ If an effect “do ●●” and an effect “can’t ●●” overlap, the instruction for “can’t ●●” takes precedence.

◆
Even if there is a part of the card text that you can’t follow, you can still use its attacks, Abilities, and Trainer
cards. If so, only follow the instructions for the parts you can follow. However, if you can’t follow the text due
to wording such as “Do ●●. If you do, do ▲▲,” do not follow any parts of the text.

◆
If a number is specified in the card text, you may not reduce the number as you wish. However, if choosing a
card from the deck (see H. Deck) and if the card texts say “...choose up to n,” you may choose between 1 and
n.

◆
If the number of the target is fewer than the number that is specified in the card text, follow the closest
number to which it was specified.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

B
Damage Calculation

#### B-0 1
Add ● damage
◆
This refers to increasing the base damage when calculating damage. It refers to the + sign that is next to the
attack damage.

◆
This text is treated as damage calculation rather than an effect. This damage calculation is done in step 1.
Calculation of Damage by Attacks of the Damage Calculation step.

◆
Same as “add ● damage” of the pre-XY series.

[Example 1] Attack, Leaf Blade (Dartrix SMA 003/059)

When a Pokémon has devolved and returned to its pre-evolution form, cards and damage counters that were
attached to it move to the pre-evolution Pokémon. All Special Conditions and effects are removed. If the
number of damage counters that were kept from the pre-evolution Pokémon were more than the pre-
evolution Pokémon’s remaining HP, that Pokémon is Knocked Out.

◆
Unless otherwise stated, devolved Pokémon are treated as new Pokémon in play, and they cannot evolve
during that turn.

◆
Stage 1 or Stage 2 Pokémon that are removed from Pokémon in play may be referred to as Evolution cards or
cards that evolve.

◆
Evolution cards that are stacked on top of the Pokémon to be devolved must be removed from the top.

◆
Stage 1 or Stage 2 Pokémon that were directly put into play due to attack effects, etc. can’t be devolved.

#### C-1 4
X can’t retreat

[Example 2] Ability, Cursed Whirlpool (Spiritomb SM3+ 048/072)
As long as this Pokémon is in your Active Spot, your opponent’s Active Pokémon can’t retreat.

effect is completely removed. The effect is also completely removed when that Pokémon evolves or devolves.

◆
You may switch your Active Pokémon with your Benched Pokémon using effects from Items and the like.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

#### C-1 5
X can’t attack
◆
You can’t choose and announce any of the attacks of Pokémon affected by this effect. Even if sufficient attack
cost is attached to the Pokémon, you can’t announce its attacks.

[Example 1] Ability, Disgusting Pollen (Vileplume SM3H 003/051)
As long as this Pokémon is your Active Pokémon, your opponent’s Basic Pokémon can’t attack.

◆
If “can’t use X” is written in the card text, all other attacks other than the specified attack can be chosen and
used.

[Example 2] Attack, Slashing Strike (Fearow SM1M 046/060)
This Pokémon can’t use Slashing Strike during your next turn.

◆
If a Pokémon is affected by this effect due to attacks, when that Pokémon is put back onto the Bench or is

this effect take damage from attacks.

[FAQ] Attack, Psychic Fangs (Bruxish SM1M 016/060)
This attack’s damage isn’t affected by any effects on your opponent’s Active Pokémon.

Damage from attacks that have the text "isn’t affected by any effects" can be applied
disregarding the status of "prevent all damage from attacks."

#### C-1 7
Prevent all effects of attacks
◆
If a Pokémon affected by this effect is affected by effects of attacks, proceed to the steps for using attacks
without performing 5. Effects other than damage in Steps for using attacks.

[Example 1] Attack, Agility (Noibat SM3H 046/051)

the original effect that was already on that Pokémon isn’t removed and that effect continues to be applied.

◆
While a Pokémon is affected by Special Conditions from attacks, even if it’s affected by a new effect that
prevents effects, the original Special Conditions that were already on that Pokémon aren’t removed.

[Examples of effects that do not get applied]

Flip a coin. If heads, your opponent’s Active Pokémon is now Paralyzed.

opponent's Pokémon's attacks and use it as this attack.

[Example 2] Attack, Imittack (Kecleon BW8 046/051)
Choose 1 of your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s attacks. If this Pokémon has the necessary Energy
to use that attack, use it as this attack.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

◆
Unless there are other special instructions, you can use this attack even when the attack cost is insufficient.

◆
If choosing an attack of a Pokémon in play with this effect, you can only choose from Pokémon with…attack.

[FAQ 1] Attack, Slashing Strike (Fearow SM1M 046/060)
This Pokémon can’t use Slashing Strike during your next turn.

Nihilego’s attack Nightcap allows you to choose other Pokémon’s damage or effects of attacks,
but the name of the attack remains Nightcap. Thus, even if you choose to use Slashing Strike by
using Nightcap and are affected by the effect “can’t use Slashing Strike,” you can choose
Fearow’s Slashing Strike again on your next turn and use its damage and effects.

[FAQ 2] Attack, Firestorm (Arcanine SM1S 010/060)
Discard 3
Energy from this Pokémon.

When you choose Arcanine’s attack Firestorm by using Nihilego’s attack Nightcap, even if you
don’t have the necessary      Energy attached to Nihilego, you can use the damage and the effects
of the attack. If so, there’s no Energy to be discarded; thus, do not follow its card text, but only
apply damage, and end the attack.

#### C-1 9
X can’t play...from their hand
◆
As long as this effect is active, the player in question can’t play a specific card from their hand. This effect is
applied to the player, not to the Pokémon.

[FAQ] Attack, Agility (Noibat SM3H 046/051)
Flip a coin. If heads, prevent all effects of attacks, including damage, done to this Pokémon
during your opponent’s next turn.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

When applying this effect to a player by using an attack, regardless of whether your opponent
has a Pokémon in play that’s in a state in which it can prevent attack effects, this effect can be
applied to that player. Even if your opponent’s Active Pokémon is Noibat that’s in a state in
which it can prevent the effects of attacks due to Agility, you can still apply the effect of
Sableye’s attack Limitation to your opponent.

#### C-2 0
Look at ●● (look at ●● and…)
◆
This refers to looking at the face-down cards (e.g. deck, Prize cards, your opponent’s hand). After looking at
the face-down cards, unless there are other special instructions, put those cards back face down.

[Example 1] Ability, Search the Premises (Gumshoos-GX SM1S050/060)
You may use this Ability once during your turn. Look at your
opponent’s hand.

◆
Similar to the ones that have the wording “reveal(s) X. Then...”

[Example 2] Attack, Spelunk (Alolan Diglett SM1S 037/060)
Look at the top 3 cards of your deck and put them back on top of your deck in any order.

to put it back in the same position.

If it was Knocked Out, calculate damage and apply effects that proceed the text.

[Example 1] Attack, Rally Back (Shaymin SM3+ 008/072)
If any of your Pokémon were Knocked Out by damage from an opponent’s attack during their
last turn, this attack does 90 more damage.

◆
Even if multiple Pokémon were Knocked Out during your opponent’s last turn, only do damage calculation
and effects that follow this text once.

◆
This text is not an attack effect. Even if the Pokémon that has this text is put back onto the Bench or is
removed from play, you must do this step. You must also do this step when a Knocked-Out Pokémon is put
back into play.

#### E-1 2
(This Ability) can be used ● times
◆
This means you can use the Ability in question a specified number of times.

[Example 1] Ability, Psychic Transfer (Lunala-GX SM1M 028/060)
As often as you like during your turn (before your attack), you may move a {P} Energy from 1 of
your Pokémon to another of your Pokémon.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

[Example 2] Ability, Feather Arrow (Decidueye-GX SMA 004/059)
Once during your turn (before your attack), you may put 2 damage counters on 1 of your
opponent’s Pokémon.

◆
This wording is on a card where you announce the Ability you are using. Unless specified, your Pokémon in
play can use it.

◆ If the text says, “once during your turn,” then you can play it once during your turn. If you have multiple
Pokémon with the same Ability, you can use it once per Pokémon.

◆
If the Pokémon that used the Ability that can only be used once is removed from play, but is put back into play,
this Pokémon is treated as a different Pokémon, so this Ability can be used.

#### E-1 3
As long as this Pokémon is in play
◆
This refers to Abilities that are active while a Pokémon in question is in play.

[Example 1] Ability, Toxic Spikes (Toxapex SM1S 026/060)
Whenever your opponent’s Active Pokémon retreats, their new Active Pokémon is Poisoned.

[Example 2] Ability, Intimidating Pattern (Arbok SM3+ 038/072)
As long as this Pokémon is your Active Pokémon, your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s attacks do 30
less damage (before applying Weakness and Resistance).

This Ability only works if you have the Pokémon in play.

◆
There are Abilities that work only when the Pokémon is in the Active Spot or on the Bench.

#### E-1 4
You may not use an Ability with the same name during your turn
◆
This refers to not being able to use an Ability with the same name if you’ve already used one during your turn.

[Example 1] Ability, Plasma Search (Metagross [Team Plasma] BW8 027/051)
Once during your turn (before your attack), you may search your deck for a Team Plasma card,
reveal it, and put it into your hand. Shuffle your deck afterward. You may not use an Ability with
the same name during your turn.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

◆
If you have Pokémon with this Ability and another Ability with the same name both in play, you can only use
either one.

◆
Even if the Pokémon that used this Ability leaves the play during the turn, another Pokémon can’t use the
Ability with the same name.

#### E-1 5
You can’t apply more than 1 X Ability at a time
◆
Regardless of the number of Pokémon having the Ability in question, the effect doesn’t overlap.

[Example 1] Ability, Jungle Totem (Venusaur SM3+ 003/072)
Each basic       Energy attached to your Pokémon provides            Energy. You can’t apply more
than 1 Jungle Totem Ability at a time.

◆
Even if there were two or more of the above Pokémon, you can only be affected by one Pokémon’s worth of
effect.

#### E-1 6
Put ● damage counters instead of n on that Pokémon for this Poisoned condition
◆
This refers to applying an effect of Poison that is different from the usual Poison effect. The number of damage
counters for Poison you place during Pokémon Checkup increases.

[Example 1] Attack, Triple Poison (Crobat SM1S 023/060)
Your opponent’s Active Pokémon is now Poisoned. Put 3 damage counters instead of 1 on that
Pokémon between turns.

◆
You can recover from the above Poisoned condition the same way you do for Poison. If your Pokémon is
poisoned through normal means when it’s already poisoned in this unique manner, the new Poisoned
condition overwrites this one.

#### E-1 7
Once during your turn, if this card is in ●●, you may use this Ability
◆
This refers to when the condition of using an Ability is outside the in-play zone.

[Example 1] Ability, Mountain Pass (Trumbeak SM8 075/095)
Once during your turn (before your attack), if this Pokémon is in your hand, you may reveal it. If
you do, look at the top card of your opponent's deck and put this Pokémon in the Lost Zone. If
that card is a Supporter card, you may put it in the Lost Zone. If your opponent has no cards in
their deck, you can't use this Ability.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

[Example 2] Ability, Restoration (Darkrai-GX SM2+ 040/049)
Once during your turn (before your attack), if this Pokémon is in your discard pile, you may put it
onto your Bench. Then, attach a {D} Energy card from your discard pile to this Pokémon.

◆
It’s an Ability that can be used when the card is in the hand or the discard pile. It can’t be used when it’s in
play, but can only be used when it’s in a specified location.

◆ If it says, “Once during you turn...,” you can only use it once per turn. If you have multiple cards with the same
Ability, you can use the Ability once per card.

◆
If a card in which you have used an Ability returns to its location after leaving, that card is treated as a
different card, so this Ability can be used again.

#### E-1 8

Energy card and attach them to your Pokémon in any way you like. Then, shuffle your deck.

◆
When shuffling the deck after looking through its contents, make sure that the cards are randomized. Even if
you didn’t have the specified card due to effects such as “Add X from your deck to your hand,” if you looked
through your deck, you must shuffle it.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

#### E-1 9

2 cards.

[Example 2] Attack, Wake-Up Slap (Poliwrath SM1M 011/060)
If your opponent’s Active Pokémon is affected by a Special Condition, this attack does 80 more
damage. Then, remove all Special Conditions from that Pokémon.

◆
If you were able to follow even a single action in the first sentence, then you must do the actions that follow
“If you do.” If you couldn’t complete the actions in the first sentence, do not proceed to do only the actions
following “If you do.”

[FAQ] Max Potion (SM1+ 048/051)
Heal all damage from 1 of your Pokémon. If you do, discard all Energy from that Pokémon.

Even if you can’t follow the actions following “If you do,” you can do the action in the first sentence.
Thus, you can use the effect of Max Potion on a Pokémon that has no Energy attached to it and heal
all damage.

#### E-2 0
The end of the turn
◆
This refers to a period that’s after the attack process or a player ends their turn without using an attack, but
before Pokémon Checkup. It’s not part of Pokémon Checkup.

[Example 1] Double Aqua Energy (CP1 033/034)
This card can only be attached to Team Aqua Pokémon. Discard this card at the end of the turn
you attached it.

This card provides            Energy only while it is attached to a Team Aqua Pokémon.

(If this card is attached to anything other than a Team Aqua Pokémon, discard this card.)

[Example 2] Attack, Doom News (Absol SM1+ 038/051)
Put all Energy attached to this Pokémon into your hand. At the end of your opponent’s next turn,
the Defending Pokémon will be Knocked Out.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

◆
If there are multiple effects that get activated at the end of the turn, the player with the card that takes that
effect can choose the order.

#### E-2 1
Until the end of your next turn

◆
The effect lasts until the end of your next turn after the turn in which you used Attacks, Trainers, Abilities, etc.
containing this text.

◆
The effect lasts during Pokémon Checkup.

[Example 1] Attack, Gastro Acid (Arbok XY1 025/060)
The Defending Pokémon has no Abilities until the end of your next turn.
[Example 2] Attack, Perplexing Eyes (Espurr SM3N 024/051)
The Defending Pokémon's Weakness is now       until the end of your next turn. (The amount of
Weakness doesn't change.)

[FAQ] Ability, Rough Skin (Sharpedo SM1M 039/060)
If this Pokémon is your Active Pokémon and is damaged by an opponent’s attack (even if this
Pokémon is Knocked Out), put 3 damage counters on the Attacking Pokémon.

The effect of this attack starts activating as soon as the effect is applied to your opponent’s
Active Pokémon. If you used the attack Gastro Acid on Sharpedo with the Ability Rough Skin, the
Ability is removed, so the effect of the Ability Rough Skin doesn’t get applied.

[FAQ] Ability, Wall of Sand (Palossand SM1M 034/060)
This Pokémon takes 20 less damage from attacks.

If the attack Gastro Acid is used on Palossand with the Ability, Wall of Sand, damage is changed
before applying the effects, so the effect of the Ability, Wall of Sand is activated.

#### E-2 2
Until the end of your opponent’s next turn

◆
The effect lasts until the end of your opponent’s next turn after the turn in which you used Attacks, Trainers,
Abilities, etc. containing this text.

When you play this Pokémon from your hand to evolve 1 of your Pokémon during your turn, you
may prevent all effects of your opponent’s attacks, including damage, done to this Pokémon until
the end of your opponent’s next turn.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

#### E-2 3
If this Pokémon evolved from ●● during this turn

◆
This refers to checking whether the Pokémon that used that attack had evolved during the turn in which the
attack printed on the card was used.

[Example 1] Attack, Sudden Sting (Beedrill SM4A 003/050)
If this Pokémon evolved from Kakuna during this turn, your opponent’s Active Pokémon is now
Paralyzed and Poisoned.

[Example 2] Attack, Raid (Zebstrika SM8a 008/052)
If this Pokémon evolved from Blitzle during this turn, this attack does 90 more damage.

[FAQ] GX Attack, Trickster-GX (Zoroark-GX SM3+ 054/072)
Choose 1 of your opponent’s Pokémon’s attacks and use it as this attack. (You can’t use more than
1 GX attack in a game.)

If Zoroark-GX that evolved from Zorua used its GX Attack, Trickster-GX and chose Beedrill’s attack,
Sudden Sting, since Zoroark-GX didn’t evolve from Kakuna, it can’t Poison or Paralyze the
opponent’s Active Pokémon.

◆ Evolution is not an effect. Even if the Pokémon with this text had once been returned to the Bench due to
effects of Trainers and Abilities, you must follow the Evolution-related instructions.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

#### E-2 4
If this Pokémon was on the Bench and became your Active Pokémon this turn

◆
This refers to checking whether the Attacking Pokémon moved from the Bench to your Active Spot during the
turn you’re using the attack. How you moved it to the Active Spot includes using Trainers, Abilities, and Retreat.
If the Pokémon was on the Bench and became your Active Pokémon, calculate damage and effects that follow
the text.

[Example 1] Attack, Surprise Strike (Crobat SM1S 023/060)
If this Pokémon was on the Bench and became your Active Pokémon this turn, this attack does 60
more damage.

◆
The wording “was on the Bench and became the Active Pokémon” is not an effect of the attack. Even if a
Pokémon was on the Bench and became the Active Pokémon multiple times due to effects of Trainer cards
and Abilities, only calculate damage and effects once.

#### E-2 5
If you played a Supporter card from your hand during this turn

◆
This refers to checking whether you “played a Supporter card from your hand” which can be done during your
turn in which you used an attack with this text. If a Supporter card was played, calculate damage and effects
that follow this text.

[Example 1] Attack, Sensitive Blade (Virizion-GX SM7a 006/060)
If you played a Supporter card from your hand during this turn, this attack does 80 more damage.

◆
Playing “a Supporter card from your hand” in this text is not an effect of an attack. This will still apply even if
the Pokémon returned to the Bench or even if it is no longer in play. Also, this will still apply even if the
Supporter card is removed from the discard pile.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

#### E-2 6
If this Pokémon was healed during this turn

◆
This refers to checking whether the Attacking Pokémon has recovered 10 or more HP during the turn in which
you’re using an attack. If HP was restored, calculate damage and effects that follow this text.

[Example 1] Attack, Hefty Whip (Tangrowth SM7b 002/050)
If this Pokémon was healed during this turn, this attack does 130 more damage.

◆ The “heal” in this text is not an effect of an attack. Even if HP was restored multiple times, only calculate
damage and effects once. Even if the Pokémon was put back onto the Bench or put back into the Active Spot
after healing on the Bench, this still applies.

#### E-2 7
This attack can be used even if ●●

◆
Even if Pokémon are in a condition in which they can’t use attacks, if they have fulfilled a specified situation,
they can use attacks.

[Example 1] Attack, Fast Raid (Pheromosa-GX SM4+ 012/114)
If you go first, you can use this attack on your first turn.

[Example 2] Attack, Toss and Turn (Snorlax XY10 057/078)
This attack can be used even if this Pokémon is Asleep. If it is, this attack does 90 more damage.

◆
Even if it’s not a specified situation, if the Pokémon can attack according to the rules, it can use the attack
that’s written in this text.

#### E-2 8
Put ● damage counters instead of n on Burned Pokémon

◆
This refers to an effect that is different from the usual Burn effect. The number of damage counters you place
during Pokémon check is changed to the number indicated in the card text.

[Example 1] Ability, Scorching Scales (Volcarona BW4 015/069)
Put 4 damage counters instead of 2 on your opponent's Burned
Pokémon between turns.

[Example 2] Ability, Flaming Fighter (Infernape SM5S 020/066)
Put 6 damage counters instead of 2 on your opponent's Burned Pokémon between turns.
[FAQ 1] If multiple cards have this card text, only one effect with the largest value is applied.

Even if you have 2 Infernapes with the Ability, Flaming Fighter in play, the Ability’s effect does
not stack. Thus, you put 6 damage counters on your opponent’s Burned Pokémon during
Pokémon check.

[Example 2] Ability, Scorching Scales (Volcarona BW4 015/069)
Put 4 damage counters instead of 2 on your opponent's Burned Pokémon between turns.
If you have both a Volcanora with the Ability, Scorching Scales and an Infernape with the Ability,
Flaming Fighter in play, the effect with the larger value is applied. Thus,  you put 6 damage
counters on your opponent’s Burned Pokémon during Pokémon check.

#### E-2 9
Whenever ●● plays a ▲▲ from their hand, prevent all effects

◆
As long as the card that has this effect is in play, it is not affected by effects from the specified cards played
from the hand.
◆
Even if the specified cards cannot affect the cards that have this effect, those specified cards can still be

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

played. In that case, those cards are considered played and then discarded.

[Example 1] Ability, Unnerve (Galvantula SM8a 011/052)
Whenever your opponent plays an Item or Supporter card from their
hand, prevent all effects of that card done to this Pokémon.

[Example 2] Heat Factory ♢ (SM8 093/095)
Once during each player's turn, that player may discard a       Energy card from their hand. If they
do, they draw 3 cards.
Whenever any player plays an Item or Supporter card from their hand, prevent all effects of that
card done to this Stadium card.

[FAQ 1] Guzma (SM3N 049/051)
Switch 1 of your opponent's Benched Pokémon with their Active Pokémon. If you do, switch your
Active Pokémon with 1 of your Benched Pokémon.

You can still use Supporter Guzma even if the only Benched Pokémon your opponent has is a
Galvantula with the Ability, Unnerve. In that case, you cannot switch your opponent’s Pokémon
and the succeeding effect will also not occur. Guzma is considered played and is then discarded.

[FAQ 2] Field Blower (SM2K 048/050)
Choose up to 2 in any combination of Pokémon Tool cards and Stadium cards in play (yours or
your opponent's) and discard them.

You can still use Field Blower even if the only Pokémon Tool card or Stadium card in play is Heat
Factory ♢. In that case, while you cannot discard Heat Factory ♢, Field Blower is considered
played and is then discarded.

[FAQ 3] Escape Rope (SM2+ 044/049)
Each player switches his or her Active Pokémon with 1 of his or her Benched Pokémon.
(Your opponent switches first. If a player does not have a Benched Pokémon, he or she
doesn't switch Pokémon.)

You can switch your opponent’s Active Pokémon even if the only Benched Pokémon your
opponent has is a Galvantula with the Ability, Unnerve. This is because the target of Escape
Rope’s effect is the Active Pokémon.
