Evolve
◆
You can evolve a Pokémon by stacking a Stage 1 or a Stage 2 Pokémon that shows that pre-evolution Pokémon.
You can evolve your Active Pokémon or any of your Benched Pokémon. You can evolve as many Pokémon as
you like during your turn.

◆
Neither player can evolve a Pokémon on their first turn. Any Basic Pokémon that came into play or Pokémon
that evolved on that turn can’t evolve on the same turn.

◆
When a Pokémon evolves, it keeps all Energy, Items, and damage counters that were attached to the pre-
evolution Pokémon.

◆
Evolving removes all Effects and Special Conditions.

◆
After a Pokémon evolves, it can’t use the attacks or Abilities of its previous evolution.
