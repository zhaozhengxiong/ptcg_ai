X can’t play...from their hand
◆
As long as this effect is active, the player in question can’t play a specific card from their hand. This effect is
applied to the player, not to the Pokémon.

Your opponent can't play any Item cards from their hand during their next turn.

[Example 2] Attack, Limitation (Sableye SM2L 031/050)
Your opponent can’t play any Supporter cards from their hand during their next turn.

[FAQ] Attack, Agility (Noibat SM3H 046/051)
Flip a coin. If heads, prevent all effects of attacks, including damage, done to this Pokémon
during your opponent’s next turn.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

When applying this effect to a player by using an attack, regardless of whether your opponent
has a Pokémon in play that’s in a state in which it can prevent attack effects, this effect can be
applied to that player. Even if your opponent’s Active Pokémon is Noibat that’s in a state in
which it can prevent the effects of attacks due to Agility, you can still apply the effect of
Sableye’s attack Limitation to your opponent.
