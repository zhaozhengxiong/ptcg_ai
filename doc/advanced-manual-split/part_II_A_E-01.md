#### E-1 9
Do ●●. If you do, do ▲▲.
◆
This means if you did the first action, you must do the second action.

[Example 1] Ability, Trade (Zoroark-GX SM3+ 054/072)
Once during your turn (before your attack), you may discard a card from your hand. If you do, draw
2 cards.

[Example 2] Attack, Wake-Up Slap (Poliwrath SM1M 011/060)
If your opponent’s Active Pokémon is affected by a Special Condition, this attack does 80 more
damage. Then, remove all Special Conditions from that Pokémon.

◆
If you were able to follow even a single action in the first sentence, then you must do the actions that follow
“If you do.” If you couldn’t complete the actions in the first sentence, do not proceed to do only the actions
following “If you do.”

[FAQ] Max Potion (SM1+ 048/051)
Heal all damage from 1 of your Pokémon. If you do, discard all Energy from that Pokémon.

Even if you can’t follow the actions following “If you do,” you can do the action in the first sentence.
Thus, you can use the effect of Max Potion on a Pokémon that has no Energy attached to it and heal
all damage.
