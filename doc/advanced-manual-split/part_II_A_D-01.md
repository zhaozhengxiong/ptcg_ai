#### D-1 7
Prize cards taken
◆
This refers to the number of cards taken from the Prize cards that were placed when setting up to play.

[Example 1] GX Attack, Beauty-GX (Pheromosa-GX SM4+ 012/114)
This attack does 50 damage for each Prize card your opponent has taken. (You can’t use more
than 1 GX attack in a game.)

[Example 2] Iris (BW9 071/076)
During this turn, your Pokémon’s attacks do 10 more damage to the Active Pokémon for each
Prize card your opponent has taken.

◆
When referencing the number of your Prize cards, subtract the number of Prize cards taken from a total of 6
for a 60-card deck. If playing a 30-card deck, subtract the number of Prize cards taken from a total of 3 cards.
