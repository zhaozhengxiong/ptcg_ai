#### A-01 Attacks
◆
A player can only use one attack that is written on the Active Pokémon’s card during their turn. An attack
ends your turn. If you don’t use an attack and have no other actions to take, announce to your opponent that
you’re ending your turn.

◆
To attack, you need to attach the exact number or more of the same Energy type as the Attack Cost. You can’t
use the attacks that don’t satisfy this condition.

◆
Steps for using Attacks
Follow the steps below to attack.

1. Announce the Attack:
Decide which attack to use and announce it to your opponent.
a. If the Attacking Pokémon is in a state in which it can’t attack, you can’t announce all (or specific)
attacks. Tell your opponent that you’re ending your turn without attacking.
b. If the Attacking Pokémon is Asleep or Paralyzed, you can’t announce an Attack. Tell your opponent
that you’re ending your turn without attacking.

2. Check the status of the Attacking Pokémon:
a. If the Attacking Pokémon is affected by effects such as below, flip a coin to determine whether the
attack would be successful.

Example : Attack, Smokescreen (Cyndaquil SM8 016/095)

Your opponent flips a coin. If tails, that attack does nothing.
If heads, the attack is successful. Proceed to 2-b.
If tails, the attack does nothing, and it counts as if you didn’t use the attack. Your turn ends.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

b. If the Attacking Pokémon is Confused, flip a coin to determine whether the attack is successful.
If Heads, the attack is successful. Proceed to 3.
If Tails, the attack does nothing, and it counts as if you didn’t use the attack. Put 3 damage
counters on the Attacking Pokémon. Your turn ends.

## Follow the instructions on the card if the attack text says, “Before doing damage.”

## Damage calculation
Calculate damage based on the damage that is written on the right side of the attack name. Follow the
instructions if there are details related to damage in the attack text.
→ See Steps for calculating damage

5. Effects other than damage
Follow the instructions for everything else other than damage in the attack text. Unless otherwise stated,
follow the attack text in sequence.

## Effects that activate when a Pokémon is damaged by an opponent’s attack
If your opponent’s Active Pokémon has an effect that activates when doing damage, follow those instructions.

## Check for Knock Out
Any Pokémon that has no remaining HP by damage or effects will be Knocked Out.
→ See D. Knock Out

◆
Steps for calculating damage
Follow the steps below to calculate damage.

1. Attack damage calculation
a. The damage of an attack is the number on the right side of the attack name.
b. If there is a +, ´, or - symbol next to the damage number, calculate the damage according to that
attack text. Damage calculation ends when the attack’s damage results in zero or a negative number
due to multiplication or subtraction.

## Effects on the Pokémon dealing damage

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

If the Pokémon dealing damage is affected by effects that change the damage they’re going to deal
such as below, reflect that change to the damage of step 1.
Choice Band (SM1+ 049/051): The attacks of the Pokémon this card is attached to do 30 more damage
to your opponent's Active Pokémon-GX or Active Pokémon-EX (before applying Weakness and
Resistance).

If the total damage becomes zero or a negative number due to effects such as below, end the damage
calculation step.

Example: Attack, Ferocious Bellow (Stoutland SM1S 048/060): During your opponent's next turn, the
Defending Pokémon's attacks do 50 less damage (before applying Weakness and Resistance).

## Weakness Calculation
If the Weakness type of the Pokémon that takes damage is the same type as the Pokémon dealing damage,
calculate the damage of step 2 based on the number on the right side of Weakness.

## Resistance Calculation
If the Resistance type of the Pokémon that takes damage is the same type as the Pokémon dealing
damage, calculate the damage of step 3 based on the number on the right side of Resistance.
If the damage total becomes zero or a negative number due to Resistance, end damage calculation.

## Effects on the Pokémon that takes damage
If the Pokémon that takes damage is affected by effects that change damage such as below, reflect that
change to the damage of step 4.

Choice Helmet (SM8 085/095): The Pokémon this card is attached to takes 30 less damage from the attacks
of your opponent's Pokémon-GX and Pokémon-EX (after applying Weakness and Resistance).

If the total damage becomes zero or a negative number due to Resistance, end damage calculation.

## Final amount of damage
Once the final amount of damage is determined, place the corresponding damage counters on the Pokémon
taking damage.
If the Pokémon that takes damage is in a state in which it does not take damage from attacks, do not follow
step 6, Final Amount of Damage, but end damage calculation.
