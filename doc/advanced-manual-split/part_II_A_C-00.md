#### C-0 9
Attach (up to) ▲ number of ● Energy cards to ■■
◆
This refers to attaching Energy to Pokémon in play. You always attach your own Energy to your own Pokémon.
You do not attach it to your opponent’s Pokémon.

◆
Same as pre-XY “Attach ▲ number of ● Energy cards to ■■.”

[Example 1] GX attack, Sol Burst-GX (Solgaleo-GX SM1S 040/060)
Search your deck for up to 5 Energy cards and attach them to your Pokémon in any way you like.
Then, shuffle your deck. (You can’t use more than 1 GX attack in a game.)

[Example 2] Attack, Flower Supply (Lurantis-GX SM1M 006/060)
Attach 2 basic Energy cards from your discard pile to your Pokémon in any way you like.

[Example 3] Attack, Heat Assist (Darmanitan SM6a 006/053)
Attach up to 3
Energy cards from your hand to your Pokémon in any way you like.
◆
You may attach Energy in addition to “Attach one Energy from your hand to a Pokémon (C. Energy)” that can
be done during your turn.

[FAQ] Ability, Gnawing Curse (Gengar SM4S 022/050)
Whenever your opponent attaches an Energy card from their hand to 1 of their Pokémon, put 2
damage counters on that Pokémon.

When attaching Energy from your hand due to attacks or effects of Abilities, the effect activates
each time you attach an Energy. If you attach multiple Energy cards at the same time at once, the
effect for that amount of Energy cards attached will be activated.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

If you attach an Energy to 2 of your Pokémon with the effect of Darmanitan’s attack, Heat Assist,
put 2 damage counters each to Pokémon to which Energy is attached from the effect of Gengar’s
Gnawing Curse ability. If you attach 2 Energy cards to 1 Pokémon, put 4 damage counters on that
Pokémon.
