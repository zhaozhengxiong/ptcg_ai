played. In that case, those cards are considered played and then discarded.

[Example 1] Ability, Unnerve (Galvantula SM8a 011/052)
Whenever your opponent plays an Item or Supporter card from their
hand, prevent all effects of that card done to this Pokémon.

[Example 2] Heat Factory ♢ (SM8 093/095)
Once during each player's turn, that player may discard a       Energy card from their hand. If they
do, they draw 3 cards.
Whenever any player plays an Item or Supporter card from their hand, prevent all effects of that
card done to this Stadium card.

[FAQ 1] Guzma (SM3N 049/051)
Switch 1 of your opponent's Benched Pokémon with their Active Pokémon. If you do, switch your
Active Pokémon with 1 of your Benched Pokémon.

You can still use Supporter Guzma even if the only Benched Pokémon your opponent has is a
Galvantula with the Ability, Unnerve. In that case, you cannot switch your opponent’s Pokémon
and the succeeding effect will also not occur. Guzma is considered played and is then discarded.

[FAQ 2] Field Blower (SM2K 048/050)
Choose up to 2 in any combination of Pokémon Tool cards and Stadium cards in play (yours or
your opponent's) and discard them.

You can still use Field Blower even if the only Pokémon Tool card or Stadium card in play is Heat
Factory ♢. In that case, while you cannot discard Heat Factory ♢, Field Blower is considered
played and is then discarded.

[FAQ 3] Escape Rope (SM2+ 044/049)
Each player switches his or her Active Pokémon with 1 of his or her Benched Pokémon.
(Your opponent switches first. If a player does not have a Benched Pokémon, he or she
doesn't switch Pokémon.)

You can switch your opponent’s Active Pokémon even if the only Benched Pokémon your
opponent has is a Galvantula with the Ability, Unnerve. This is because the target of Escape
Rope’s effect is the Active Pokémon.
