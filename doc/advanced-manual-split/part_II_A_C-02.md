the face-down cards, unless there are other special instructions, put those cards back face down.

You may use this Ability once during your turn. Look at your
opponent’s hand.

Similar to the ones that have the wording “reveal(s) X. Then...”

[Example 2] Attack, Spelunk (Alolan Diglett SM1S 037/060)
Look at the top 3 cards of your deck and put them back on top of your deck in any order.
