Stadiums
◆
Stadiums are Trainer cards that continue to apply an effect to both players and their Pokémon when a player
plays them. You may only play 1 Stadium card from your hand during your turn. A Stadium card has a rule that
states, “You may only play 1 Stadium card during your turn. Discard this card if a Stadium card with a different
name comes into play.”

◆
A Stadium you played from your hand stays in play. When either player plays a Stadium with a different name,
discard the Stadium that had been in play and switch it with the new one. A Stadium with the same name as the
one in play can’t be played from your hand.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

◆ The effects of Stadiums can be categorized into two sub-types: ones you announce to your opponent in order
for the effect to be activated, and ones in which the effect is automatically active by being in play.

◆ For Stadium cards that contain the wording “You may” or “player may,” they can be used after each player
announces the effect during their turn.
E.g. Brooklet Hill (SM2L 050/050)
Once during each player’s turn, that player may search their deck for a Basic
Pokémon or Basic
Pokémon and, put it onto their Bench. If the player does so, shuffle the deck.

◆
Steps for effects of Stadiums that need announcing
1. If there are conditions for using the Stadium, follow those instructions. If you can’t follow them, you can’t
use that Stadium. If you know that nothing would change even you follow through step 3, you can’t use it.

2. Announce to your opponent that you will be using the effect of the Stadium.

## Follow the instructions on the Stadium card. Unless otherwise stated, follow all steps in sequence.

◆ For Stadiums that do not contain the wording “You may” or “player may,” that effect automatically continues.
Unless there are special instructions or process, take all actions on the card. A player can’t remove a Stadium
effect that is automatically active at their own will.

E.g. Altar of the Moone (SM1+ 050/051)
The Retreat Cost of each Pokémon that has any
or
Energy attached to it is           less.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

C
Energy
◆
Energy are cards you need to power up your Pokémon to attack or retreat. Energy cards are categorized into
two types: Basic Energy and Special Energy.

◆
If you have an Energy in your hand, you can attach an Energy to 1 of your Pokémon per turn. There is no limit
on how many Energy cards you can attach to one Pokémon.

◆
Unless otherwise stated, Energy remains on the Pokémon even when it attacks or evolves. Keep it attached
until the Pokémon is Knocked Out. When it’s Knocked Out, discard the Energy cards along with that Pokémon.

◆
There are nine types of Basic Energy:                                                    and       . They can be distinguished by the
name and the symbol. Attaching a specific type of Energy to a Pokémon provides 1 amount of that type of
Energy. You can put as many Basic Energy cards as you like in your deck regardless of the deck rule that states,
“You can’t have more than 4 cards with the same name in your deck.”

◆
“Special Energy” is printed on the upper left corner of a Special Energy card. Special Energy is Energy that has
special effects. Their effect and use differ depending on the card. Unlike Basic Energy, Special Energy obeys
the deck rule “You can’t have more than 4 cards with the same name in your deck.”

D
Knock Out
◆
For Pokémon with no remaining HP from damage from attacks, effects of cards, or special conditions, the
Knock Out process takes place. If there is even one such Pokémon in play, the Knock Out process takes place.

◆
When to confirm Knock Out:
• At the end of the attack process
• At the end of Pokémon Checkup
• Other than the above, when a Pokémon has no remaining HP

E.g. Ability, Feather Arrow (Decidueye-GX SMA 004/059)
You may use this Ability once during your turn. Put 2 damage counters on 1 of your opponent’s Pokémon.

E.g. Rainbow Energy (SM1M 060/060)
When attaching this card from your hand to a Pokémon, put 1 damage counter on that Pokémon. As
long as this card is attached to the Pokémon, it provides 1 amount of every Energy type. If this card is
not attached to a Pokémon, it provides 1      Energy.

◆
Steps for the Knock-Out process
1. Begin the Knock-Out process if either player has any Pokémon in play that has no remaining HP.

2. Process any effects that activate when a Pokémon is Knocked Out.

3. The player who has a Pokémon that has no remaining HP treats that Pokémon as Knocked Out and
discards that Pokémon and all cards attached to it.

## Both players take the number of Prize cards that correspond to the number of their opponent’s Pokémon
that were Knocked Out.

## The other player moves the next Active Pokémon to the Active Spot.
If both players’ Active Pokémon are Knocked Out at the same time during Pokémon Checkup, the player
who goes next chooses their new Active Pokémon and puts it out onto the Active Spot. If your opponent’s
Active Pokémon has not been discarded, proceed to step 6.

## Put out your new Active Pokémon.
Unless your Active Pokémon was discarded in step 3, disregard this step.

E
Win/Lose
◆
The player who Knocks Out the opponent’s Pokémon and takes all of their Prize cards wins.

◆ If there is no Pokémon in your Active Spot due to Knock Out or effects, you must put out a new Pokémon from
the Bench. If a player has no Pokémon to put as their Active Pokémon, that player loses.

◆
If a player can’t draw a single card from their deck when drawing at the beginning of their turn, that player
loses. The player doesn’t lose when they have no cards in the deck.

◆

F
Pokémon Checkup
◆
Pokémon Checkup refers to checking each player’s Pokémon’s Special Conditions—Poisoned, Burned, Asleep,
and Paralyzed—at the end of each player’s turn. Pokémon Checkup does not count as either player’s turn and it
must be done for both players’ Pokémon.

◆
During Pokémon Checkup, not only the Special Conditions are checked, but the Pokémon’s Abilities and
Trainer effects are also checked.

E.g. Shrine of Punishment (SM7 094/096)
Between turns, put 1 damage counter on each Pokémon-GX and Pokémon-EX (both yours and your
opponent's).

◆
Steps for Pokémon Checkup

1. Check Special Conditions
Check Special Conditions in the order of Poisoned, Burned, Asleep, and Paralyzed. The check is done to
each player’s Pokémon at the same time.

## Check Abilities and Trainers’ effects that activate during Pokémon Checkup
Step 2 can be checked prior to step 1. You can’t check it during step 1.
If there are multiple effects that are activated in step 2, you can choose either to activate each effect
before step 1 or to activate it separately after step 1.

## Check for Knock Out
Pokémon that have no remaining HP due to Special Conditions or effects are Knocked Out.

Setting up to play
The following is the order when setting up to play.

## Greetings and handshake
Shake hands with your opponent.

## Play a game of rock-paper-scissors to determine which player goes first.
The winner of rock-paper-scissors decides whether to go first or second.

## Place the deck
Shuffle the deck well and place it face down in the deck location.

## Draw 7 cards
Draw 7 cards from the deck and put them into your hand.

## Place an Active Pokémon
In the order of which player is going first, announce to your opponent whether you have a Basic Pokémon
in your hand. If both players have Basic Pokémon in their hand, choose one and put it out to the Active Spot
face down. If there is no Basic Pokémon, follow the steps below.

a. Tell your opponent that you do not have any Basic Pokémon in your
hand.
• If only you didn’t have one, proceed to b.
• If both players tell each other that they don’t have any, shuffle the hand into the deck after
revealing each other’s hand to one another, and redo from step 3.

b. Your opponent proceeds to step 7.
• If this is the second (or more) time of not having any Basic Pokémon in your hand, skip b.

c. Reveal to your opponent your hand that doesn’t include any Basic Pokémon. After doing so, shuffle the
cards into the deck.

d. Return to 3 and redo the steps.

## Put Pokémon onto your Bench
If you have Basic Pokémon in your hand after putting one as the Active Pokémon, you may put the rest
onto the Bench face down (you don’t have to). Before starting the game, you can put Basic Pokémon onto
your Bench whenever you like.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

## Place Prize cards
Take the top 6 cards of the deck and place them face down as your Prize cards.
After placing the Prize cards, if your opponent has completed 5d, you may announce the number of cards
for each time your opponent has to complete 5d. After announcing the number of cards, you draw that
many cards. If the card you drew is a Basic Pokémon, you may put it onto your Bench.

## Begin the game
Both players turn their Active Pokémon and Benched Pokémon face up and begin the game.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

H
Deck
◆
If instructed to draw cards, take the specified number of cards face down from the top of your deck, and put
them into your hand.

◆
If instructed to choose cards from a deck (search), check the face of cards in your deck as you look through
and choose the designated number of cards. Do not show your opponent the face of the cards you are looking
through. If choosing multiple cards, you may choose a number that is fewer than that number. You may also
not choose any cards, and if you do not, the card selection ends here. However, if instructed to choose
whatever card you like, you must choose the specified number of cards.

◆
If instructed to shuffle the deck, shuffle the cards so that each player can’t figure out the order of the cards.
When shuffling, keep the cards face down. When looking through the deck from effects such as “Search your
deck for ●● and put them into your hand,” as a general rule, you must shuffle your deck.

Pokémon Card Game Advanced Players’ Rulebook Ver.2.2

## II. Card Text
Here, we explain certain card text that you see frequently. This section is designed to clarify terminology or questions
about the order of specific processes.

A
About Card Text
◆
If the card text is different from the game rules, follow the instructions on the card rather than the game rules.
However, if the card effect has been newly changed, use the latest effect.

◆ If an effect “do ●●” and an effect “can’t ●●” overlap, the instruction for “can’t ●●” takes precedence.

◆
Even if there is a part of the card text that you can’t follow, you can still use its attacks, Abilities, and Trainer
cards. If so, only follow the instructions for the parts you can follow. However, if you can’t follow the text due
to wording such as “Do ●●. If you do, do ▲▲,” do not follow any parts of the text.

◆
If a number is specified in the card text, you may not reduce the number as you wish. However, if choosing a
card from the deck (see H. Deck) and if the card texts say “...choose up to n,” you may choose between 1 and
n.

◆
If the number of the target is fewer than the number that is specified in the card text, follow the closest
number to which it was specified.
