#### B-0 9
This Pokémon does ● damage to itself
◆
This is an attack that does damage to the Attacking Pokémon. This is treated as damage calculation and not an
effect.

### [Example 1] Attack, Take Down (Growlithe SM1S 009/060):
This Pokémon does 20 damage to itself.

[FAQ 1] Eviolite (BW2 065/066)
If the Pokémon this card is attached to is a Basic Pokémon, any damage done to this Pokémon by
attacks is -20.

This kind of damage calculation is done the same way as an ordinary damage calculation. Unless
there are no special instructions, Weakness and Resistance as well as effects are also calculated.
If Growlithe uses its attack, Take Down, while having Eviolite attached to it, the damage that
Growlithe takes is 20 less due to Eviolite under 5. Effects on the damage taking Pokémon.

[FAQ 2] Choice Helmet (SM8 085/095)
The Pokémon this card is attached to takes 30 less damage from the attacks of your opponent's
Pokémon-GX and Pokémon-EX (after applying Weakness and Resistance).

When a Pokémon to which Choice Helmet is attached takes damage by an attack from your own
Pokémon, the effect of the Choice Helmet does not get activated. Similarly, when Growlithe uses
its attack, Take Down, while having Choice Helmet attached to it, Choice Helmet can’t reduce the
damage by 30.
